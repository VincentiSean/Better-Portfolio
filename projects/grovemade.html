                    The intent with replicating the <a class="proj-ref-link" target="_blank" href="https://grovemade.com/">Grove Made</a> landing page was to learn how to use outside sources. I wanted to incorporate the <a class="proj-ref-link"  href="https://swiperjs.com/">Swiper</a> slider and learn how to utilize APIs.

                            The main reason for building the GroveMade webpage was to use the Swiper and learn more about making the process of web development easier by using API calls and outside sources. Both serve as great tools for faster development and, generally, more dynamic and responsive web content.

                            Learning from my past mistakes, I also chose to replicate a website that had a great and defined mobile design.

                            I started work on this site with the mobile first design. Beginning at 350px and working my way up, the development process was much smoother with a clear design and starting small.

                            Use to using what I know, reading the documentation slowed the development down on this project by a little.

                            It was by no means complex, but having to learn how to adjust the amount of displayed items and adjust for breakpoints was not intuitive with what I already knew and took a moment.

                            Where I learned from my past in reguards to mobile development, I later learned I made mistakes in other areas. One goal I had intended for this project was to learn more about 'em' and I thought you should use them on everything.
                            <br><br>
                            Since finishing this project, I have read a few articles and watched a video that describes how changing a user's default font-size is not an accessibiliy best practice. 'Rem' should be used as the user can change their default font-size and 'Rem' plays into that feature.

<!-- 
    Issues:
        The slider and it's issues
        Not planned well -> menus and messy code

    What I Tried to Learn:
        Using ems (not exactly best practice -> rems)
        Using an outside source -> the slider
        Using a full mobile -> desktop process
